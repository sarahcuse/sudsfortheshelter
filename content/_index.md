Roughly 40% of the youth experiencing homelessness identify as LGBTQ, with the number one reason they experience homelessness being family rejection of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

The Rescue Mission and ACR Health want to build an emergency shelter to help in addressing this issue, and we intend to raise money to help them achieve their goal.
